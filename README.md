# PD:TH BiggerLobbies
- Mod developed in spare time for the peak payday game
- Yes this is my first PD:TH mod
- I've some good lua experience but no modding experience, yes this was ambitious
- Some code sourced from the decomp (where necessary to alter hard-coded variables)
- Some code referenced from PD2 BigLobby (much less than you'd expect, mainly network client stuff)

# THIS IS ALL COMPLETELY UNTESTED
I'll probably update this at some point (I'm busy at the moment, when I get time I'll probably work on DSBLT over this)

Feel free to make PRs, I'll look over them when I get time
